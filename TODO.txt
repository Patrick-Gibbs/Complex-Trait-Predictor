#1 compute a kinship matrix for each indidual and compute jacards distance, PCA can also be used.
# we are adding a Z which can be a kinship or PC otherwise a combination of both or even features from pheotypye data.
# we can play with changing which one is fixed and which one is random.

# Compute U from ML or baysian

# for matrix julia -> R use csv for now.

# also scope out the literature., try chi2^2 dist or other.

# thus create a mixed model.


# get micro.
